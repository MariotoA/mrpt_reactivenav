# mrpt_reactivenav
A wrapper ROS package for mrpt's 3D reactive navigation system that also works as a BaseLocalPlanner plugin.

This repo, for now, is just for me. It's still uncompleted. Do not try to use it.

As of now, try working your way around https://github.com/mrpt-ros-pkg/mrpt_navigation instead.

This branch was a project to be able to visualize ptgs in rviz. Not working in this for now...
